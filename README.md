An Android app to make scouting FRC matches entirely digital and make paper scouting a think of the past! This code was written for the FIRST Robotics Competition by Team 2706: Merge Robotics.

We release our software under the MIT license in the hopes that other teams use and/or modify our software.

Our one request is that if you do find our code helpful, please send us an email at frc2706@owcrobots.ca letting us know. We love to hear when we've helped somebody, and we'd like to be able to measure our impact on the community.

Thanks, and enjoy!
