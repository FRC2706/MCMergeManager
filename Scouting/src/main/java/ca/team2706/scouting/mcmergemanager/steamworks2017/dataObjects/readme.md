[MikeO] So, in writing the StatsEngine for Steamworks2017, I realized that this is a lot of stuff to massage each year.

In the off-season it's worth looking at what can be abstracted so that it's not game-specific.
Unfortunately, most of this really is either game-specific data, or game-specific logic :'(
